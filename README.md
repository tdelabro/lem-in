This project was the occasion to familiarise myself with **graph theory.**

I implemented a **breadth first search algorithm** inside a custom version of the **Fordâ€“Fulkerson algorithm**, specially tiwsted to answer the distinctive features of the subject.

It's about bringing a certain number of ants through a labyrinthine anthill, from the strat node (source) to the end node (sink), in the minimum amount of turns. Each ant can only moove one node at a time and it's forbiden to have two ants in the same node at the same time.
